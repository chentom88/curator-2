### Typography

pui-react-typography is no longer supported.
Replace `<DefaultH2>`, `<AlternateH2>` or `<MarketingH2>` with `<h2>`.
The headers will now be less bold. This is intended by the designers.
If your application wants headers to be bigger and bolder, add CSS in your own application.

### Renames

- `<BasicInput>` becomes `<Input>`
- `<SearchInput>` becomes `<Input search>`
- `<SimpleTabs>` becomes `<Tabs>`
- `<SimpleTabsAlt>` becomes `<Tabs tabType="simple-alt">`
- `<SortableTable>` becomes `<Table>`
- `<OverlayTrigger trigger={['hover']}>` becomes `<OverlayTrigger trigger="hover">`
- Use `TileLayoutItem` instead of `TileLayout.Item`
- Look for `RadioGroup` in `pui-react-radio`

### Other changes

- Stop using the `fancy-select` CSS class, just use regular selects.
If you want a fancy chooser, consider dropdowns.
- Provide a class to Input with the `inputClassName` prop instead of `className`.
- DropdownItem no longer automatically wraps content in an `a` tag unless an `href` prop is provided.
- The markup generated by tooltips is different. The classes are prefixed with 'pui-', like 'pui-tooltip'.

### CSS Compiling

We would like to deprecate Dr Frankenstyle due to its performance issues and maintenance cost.
In PUI 4.0, you can use Webpack loaders instead.
The combination of `css-loader`, `file-loader` and `extract-text-webpack-plugin`
recreates the functionality of Dr Frankenstyle in much less time.

See the [Webpack Config](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/react-starter/blob/master/config/webpack.config.js) in React Starter.
In React Starter `NODE_ENV=production gulp assets` will output a `components.css` file
in addition to any fonts and images needed by that CSS into `public`.
