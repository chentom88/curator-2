We've created two starter projects to help transitioning to Pivotal UI and React.

- If you want to quickly try out some Pivotal UI components, try [PUI Starter Project](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pui-starter-project).
- If you want to skip directly to building a full React application, try [React Starter](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/react-starter).

Once you've played around with some examples and feel comfortable integrating into your project, jump to the next step below.

title: Using Pivotal UI on your project (with React)
name: 02_using-react
parent: getting-started

If you're ready to try PUI with React, follow these instructions!

Using the React components is the recommended approach over CSS/HTML because:

- You have reusable, maintainable code that is more consistent. (compare the React Tabs element to HTML version)
- Meaningful variables for color mean that you remember why you used a particular color ("marketing-header1" vs "teal-23")
- Cross-browser and responsive issues are handled for you.
- It's the future.

**However, you'll need to know a few more technologies. Not enough to write a PHD thesis, but mostly in case things go wrong.
If you don't know what React, Bootstrap, babel or a transpiler is, follow the links below and then return**

- [React Overview](http://facebook.github.io/react/)
- [Bootstrap Overview](http://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Overall workflow](http://www.jayway.com/2015/03/04/using-react-with-ecmascript-6/)

Ready? We're assuming that you have the following setup on your project:

 - **node**

    ```
    brew install node
    ```
 - **node package manager**

    npm will be installed as part of node

 - **Webpack or Browserify** - Our React modules follow the CommonJS module
    pattern. You will need to use [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) (recommended) or
    [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) to compile your javascript for use
    in the browser.

    We use [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and [Webpack Stream](https://github.com/shama/webpack-stream).

 - **A JSX transpiler** - It's easiest to write React code with [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html).
    You will need a transpiler to convert your JSX code into plain javascript
    for use in the browser. We recommend [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).
    If you are using Webpack, you will also want [Babel Loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader)

    Getting Babel working can be complicated. To see a sample project with Babel integrated,
    look at [React Starter](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/react-starter) or [PUI Starter Project](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pui-starter-project)

 - **React**
 
    ```
    npm install react react-dom --save-dev
    ```


Seem overwhelming? It's time to talk with a front-end dev on the Pivotal team on how to hook this into your project.

##Install##

1. Create a package.json file that will include the PUI modules you'll be using
    `npm init`

1. Install [Dr. Frankenstyle](http://github.com/pivotal-cf/dr-frankenstyle).
   This tool looks at your PUI modules and compiles the CSS required by these packages.(those added with --save, **NOT**
   --save-dev),

    ```
npm install -g dr-frankenstyle
    ```

1. Install a PUI module for the components you need. No need to install
   additional CSS packages. Our React packages tell Dr. Frankenstyle what
   CSS is needed for each component.

    For example, to create a button:

    ```
npm install --save pui-react-buttons
    ```

1. Run Dr. Frankenstyle to compile your CSS to a folder (we use `./build/` but you can choose whatever makes sense for your project).

    Writes the compiled css to <path-to-your-asset-build-folder>/components.css

    `dr-frankenstyle <path-to-your-asset-build-folder>`

1. Add the compiled css to your html template

     ```html
   <!doctype html>
   <html>
     <head>
       <title>...</title>
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="<path-to-your-asset-build-folder>/components.css">

     </head>
     <body>
       <!-- ... -->
       <script src="<path-to-your-project's-compiled-javascript-file>"></script>
     </body>
   </html>
     ```

1. Write some React!

    Javascript:


    ```
    var React = require('react');
    var DefaultButton = require('pui-react-buttons').DefaultButton;

    var MyTestPage = React.createClass({
     getInitialState: function() {
       return {showMessage: false};
     },

     showMessage: function() {
       this.setState({showMessage: true});
     },

     render: function() {
       return (
         <div className="container">
           <DefaultButton onClick={this.showMessage}>Show Message</DefaultButton>
           { this.state.showMessage ? <h1>Hello world!</h1> : null }
         </div>
       );
     }
    });

    ReactDOM.render(<MyTestPage />, document.getElementById('root'));
    ```

    HTML


    ```html
     <!-- ... -->
     <body>
       <div id="root"></div>

       <!-- Script tag should be below all DOM elements -->
       <script src="<path-to-your-project's-compiled-javascript-file>"></script>
     </body>
     <!-- ... -->
    ```


1. Every time you install a new PUI React module, you will need to rerun
   Dr. Frankenstyle to update your compiled CSS.

    ```
npm install --save pui-react-alerts
dr-frankenstyle <path-to-your-asset-build-folder>
    ```

    See the [Dr. Frankenstyle docs](http://github.com/pivotal-cf/dr-frankenstyle) for more information

title: Using Pivotal UI on your project (without React)
name: 03_without-react
parent: getting-started
---

React is the recommended approach (see reasons above), but some elements are available in HTML/CSS

The prefered way to consume Pivotal UI is through NPM, even for Rails
projects. Using NPM to install PUI will ensure proper dependency management on
your project.

1. Run `npm init` if you don't have a package.json file already.

1. Install [Dr. Frankenstyle](http://github.com/pivotal-cf/dr-frankenstyle).
   This tool looks at your dependencies (those added with --save, **NOT**
   --save-dev), and compiles the CSS required by these packages.

    ```
   npm install --save-dev dr-frankenstyle
    ```

1. Install the Pivotal UI CSS modules

    ```
   npm install --save pui-css-all
    ```

    If you only want to include a few PUI components in your project, see the
    instructions below on [customizing your PUI build](#04_customize).

1. Install jQuery and bootstrap.js

    ```
   npm install --save-dev jquery
   npm install --save-dev bootstrap
    ```

    These installs must happen **after** you've installed the PUI module. This
    ensures you'll get the correct version of bootstrap js.

    **It's important that you install these modules with `--save-dev`,
    because we don't want Dr. Frankenstyle to pick up any CSS from these
    packages.**

1. Run Dr. Frankenstyle to compile your CSS to a folder (we use `./build/` but you can choose whatever makes sense for your project)

    ```
   dr-frankenstyle <path-to-your-asset-build-folder>
   # writes the compiled css to <path-to-your-asset-build-folder>/components.css
    ```

1. Add the css and javascript files to your html template

    ```html
   <!doctype html>
   <html>
     <head>
       <title>...</title>
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="<path-to-your-asset-build-folder>/components.css">
       <script src="<path-to-your-project's-root-folder>/node-modules/jquery/dist/jquery.js"></script>
       <script src="<path-to-your-project's-root-folder>/node-modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.js"></script>
     </head>
     <body>
       <!-- ... -->
     </body>
   </html>
    ```

1. Write some CSS/HTML and enjoy!

    ```html
   <!-- ... -->
   <body>
     <div class="container">
       <h1 class="type-brand-1 em-high">Hello world!</h1>
     </div>
   </body>
   <!-- ... -->
    ```

1. Upgrade PUI frequently

    ```
npm update pui-css-all
dr-frankenstyle <path-to-your-asset-build-folder>
    ```

   **NB - You must rerun Dr. Frankenstyle after you update PUI (or add any
   additional CSS module).**

title: Customizing your PUI build
name: 04_customize
parent: getting-started
---

If you don't want all of Pivotal UI, you can install only the modules you will
need. This will make your resultant CSS smaller! Let's say you're building an
app that only has typography and buttons.

1. Remove the `pui-css-all` module from your project.

    ```
   npm uninstall --save pui-css-all
    ```

1. Add the necessary PUI CSS modules. For this example

    ```
   npm install --save pui-css-typography
   npm install --save pui-css-buttons
    ```

    Use the styleguide to determine which modules you need to install. Each
    component contains module information at the beginning of its docs:

    ![Example of styleguide installation instructions](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/824157/8711815/22853a7a-2b0a-11e5-862a-a76488de81e8.png)

1. Rerun Dr. Frankenstyle

    ```
    dr-frankenstyle <path-to-your-asset-build-folder>
    ```

1. Every time you install a new PUI CSS package, you will need to rerun
   Dr. Frankenstyle.

    If you're using gulp or grunt or some other task runner,
    look at the [Dr. Frankenstyle docs](http://github.com/pivotal-cf/dr-frankenstyle)
    for how to make this step part of your task workflow.

title: Using the Pivotal UI Monolith (legacy)
name: 05_monolith
parent: getting-started
---

If you really don't want to use NPM, you can use our compiled PUI monolith.
Be warned, you will have to manage updates and dependencies yourself.

1. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pivotal-ui/releases).
1. Unzip the release archive and move the resulting directory into your project.
1. Link to the css file in your html template to include the styles.
1. Add a script tag to your html template to use the javascript.
1. Use the css classes (reference the [styleguide](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pivotal-ui#styleguide) for examples and usage)

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>...</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/release/pivotal-ui.css">
    <script src="/path/to/release/pivotal-ui.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p class='type-brand-1'>Hello, world!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

You'll need to maintain the structure in the release directory to have fonts
and assets work properly. **Do not modify the release files directly**. If you
need a component and you cannot find it in the styleguide, write your own
styles and javascript separately. Doing so will make it easier to update to
newer versions.

title: Including SCSS variables and mixins (optional, beta)
name: 06_variables-and-mixins
parent: getting-started

If you are building CSS using Sass, you can get pivotal-ui variables and mixins
from the [pui-css-variables-and-mixins](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pui-css-variables-and-mixins)
node module.

```
npm install --save pui-css-variables-and-mixins
```

Import the file and use the variables:

```scss
@import '<path-to-your-projects-node-modules>/pui-css-variables-and-mixins/pui-variables.scss';
@import '<path-to-your-projects-node-modules>/pui-css-variables-and-mixins/mixins.scss';

.bg-special {
  background-color: $brand-1;
}
```
