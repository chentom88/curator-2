By default, code blocks will not have syntax highlighting.
To enable this, use the [PUI PrismJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pui-prismjs) package.
It is a wrapper around [Prism](http://prismjs.com).

```sh
npm install pui-prismjs
```

You will also need to include a Prism theme.

```sh
npm install prismjs-default-theme
# or
npm install prismjs-okaidia-theme
```
